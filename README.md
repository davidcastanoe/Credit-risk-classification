# Credit Risk Classification

## Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Analysis
the purpose of the analysis aims to help lenders understand the risks involved in lending money, develop models that can predict what might happen with loans, and use data to make informed decisions. By doing this, lenders can improve their lending practices to reduce the chances of losing money. Ultimately, the goal is to figure out which borrowers are more likely to pay back their loans on time, thus allowing lenders to make safer decisions and avoid financial losses.

## Results 
- Healthy Loans (Label 0)
    - Precision =   1.00
    - Recall =      0.99
    - F1-score=     1.00
- High-risk Loans (Label 1)
    - Precision =   0.85
    - Recall =      0.95
    - F1-score=     0.89

## Summary
The model is really good at spotting loans that are likely to be paid back on time (healthy loans). It hardly ever makes mistakes with these predictions. For loans that might be risky (high-risk loans), the model is pretty good but not perfect. It sometimes says a loan is risky when it's actually okay, but it catches most of the truly risky loans.

Overall, the model is solid and should be used by the company. It's great at picking out loans that are safe to give out, which helps the company avoid losing money. Even though it's not perfect with risky loans, it still does a good job overall. However, there's always room for improvement, so the company might want to keep an eye on how the model performs and see if there are ways to make it even better.
